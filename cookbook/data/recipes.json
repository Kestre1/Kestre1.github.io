	    "**Stir all ingredients together in a bowl,** except the nuts for garnish. Order doesn't matter. After stirring, the mixture should be a uniform color. The frozen blueberries will melt, that's fine. (Hint: this mixture is vegan. You have a stirring spoon. The stirring spoon can go in your mouth.)",
